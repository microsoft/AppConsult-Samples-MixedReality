## [CallRemoteAssistMinimal](CallRemoteAssistMinimal) = Minimal sample code 📄 ready to use

If you look for a minimal code for HoloLens, we can just handle the AirTap to initiate the Remote Assist call.


## [CallRemoteAssistFromYourHoloLensApp](CallRemoteAssistFromYourHoloLensApp) = Sample 📦 with a Tagalong billboard following the user gaze 

The sample provide you a Holographic button that is always

- Following you (the camera).
- Oriented in front of you.
- At a fixed distance from you.
- Visible and not directly in the center of the field of view: it seeks to have a part of itself in the view frustum of the camera

The purpose of this sample is to provide you an out of the box tagalong billboard for you apps 🎁!

> **Note:** The code was updated to support Unity 2017.4.15f1

> **Note:** Keep the Unity folder/project as close as possible to the root of the disk like C:\_Dev\MyApp in order to prevent Unity or Visual studio loading issues with very long paths
